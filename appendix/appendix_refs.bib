    abstract = {There has been significant progress in the field of sentiment analysis. However, aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) has not been explored in the Japanese language even though it has a huge scope in many natural language processing applications such as 1) tracking sentiment towards products, movies, politicians etc; 2) improving customer relation models. The main reason behind this is that there is no standard Japanese dataset available for ABSA task. In this paper, we present the first standard Japanese dataset for the hotel reviews domain. The proposed dataset contains 53,192 review sentences with seven aspect categories and two polarity labels. We perform experiments on this dataset using popular ABSA approaches and report error analysis. Our experiments show that contextual models such as BERT works very well for the ABSA task in the Japanese language and also show the need to focus on other NLP tasks for better performance through our error analysis.},
